 ! ALL non-root tags accept an optional `ts` attribute which denotes the

 ! The attribute SHOULD be omitted for elements which will never have a

 ! The `ts` attribute on the main Game element represents the time at which
 ! the game started.
 ! Timestamps SHOULD be in RFC3339 datetime format. If only the time is
 ! available, the date can be inferred from the original file's lastmod or
 ! the timestamp can instead be saved in ISO8601 time-only format.
