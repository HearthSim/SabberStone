# SabberStone

SabberStone is just another Hearthstone simulator and implementation, written in C#. The project was started in Nov'16 while trying to implement aura, buffs & triggers into Brimstone. Focused to prototype my so called onion system I created SabberStone, which is using a layer approach to handle entity changing enchantments. Since then I haven't stopped implementing day by day new cards, new tests and new stuff. I created for fun a visualisation and a scoring based tree search a.i. which can be used to play games ([SabberStoneGui](/SabberStoneGui)). If also implemented a few current decks of the "JANUARY 2017, SEASON 34", like the PirateAggroWarrior and the MidrangeJadeShaman.

By now this is a one man show, but there is still a lot of work to do, so any help is appreciated. The base code of ([Brimstone](https://github.com/HearthSim/Brimstone/tree/master/Brimstone)) was a great inspiration for this project. Big thanks to **@Pattux**, **@Patashu** & **@Katy** for helping on hearthstone super science problems ^^ You're welcome!


### Project Structure ###

* **SabberStoneCore** *(.NET Core)*

  Core simulator engine, all the functions needed for the simulator are in here. Check out the Wiki [Link](https://github.com/HearthSim/SabberStoneCore/wiki) for informations about the core and how to use it.

* **SabberStoneCoreTest** *(.NET Core)*

  UnitTest for the simulator, there is a generated test for each card in the current game.

* **SabberStoneCoreConsole** *(.NET Core)*

  A test project to run simple codeline based games to test outcome.

* **SabberStoneCoreAi** *(.NET Core)*

  A test project to run A.I. simulations with predefinied decks and strategys.

* **SabberStoneGui** *(.NET Framework)*

  A test project that shows off a visual implementation of the SimpleAi project. This is probably where beginners should start looking at. There is a simple GUI which allows different decks to play against each other with different strategys. Check out the Wiki [Link] (https://github.com/HearthSim/SabberStone/wiki/SabberStoneGui) for informations about the use of SimpleUi.

  tbd

### Installation

**Most important part to have it run right now is that you change the path to your current folder**

ex. C:\Users\admin\Source\Repos\SabberStone\ --> C:\Users\admin\Source\Repos\

```csharp
namespace SabberStoneCore.Loader
{
    internal class CardLoader : ICardLoader
    {
        private static string _path { get; set; }

        public static string Path {
            get
            {
                if (_path == null)
                {
                    _path = @"C:\Users\admin\Source\Repos\"; // <--- CHANGE TO YOUR FOLDER ... WHERE SABBERSTONE IS
                }

                return _path;
            }
        } 
```
