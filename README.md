# Overview

**State of Implementation: 91% (Knights of the Frozen Throne 39%) of current Standard Cards (Year of the ... Maaaaaamooouth)!** ***(30.08.2017)***

SabberStone is just another Hearthstone simulator and implementation, written in C#. The project was started in Nov'16 while trying to implement aura, buffs & triggers into Brimstone. Focused to prototype my so called onion system I created SabberStone, which is using a layer approach to handle entity changing enchantments. Since then I haven't stopped implementing day by day new cards, new tests and new stuff. I created for fun a visualisation and a scoring based tree search a.i. which can be used to play games ([SabberStoneGui](/extensions/SabberStoneGui)). If also implemented a few current decks of the "JANUARY 2017, SEASON 34", like the PirateAggroWarrior and the MidrangeJadeShaman.

By now this is a one man show, but there is still a lot of work to do, so any help is appreciated. The base code of Brimstone was a great inspiration for this project. Big thanks to **@Pattux**, **@Patashu** for helping on hearthstone super science problems ^^ thx **@Katy** for inspiration. And thx a lot to **@Citiral**, **@BertP** & **@Milva** for working out on the stove implementation. You're welcome!

**Sabberstone Simulator can be connected to the real Hearthstone client!**

### Project Structure ###

* **SabberStoneCore** *(.NET Core)*

  Core simulator engine, all the functions needed for the simulator are in here. Check out the Wiki [Link](https://github.com/HearthSim/SabberStone/wiki) for informations about the core and how to use it.

* **SabberStoneCoreTest** *(.NET Core)*

  UnitTest for the simulator, there is a generated test for each card in the current game.

* **SabberStoneCoreConsole** *(.NET Core)*

  A test project to run simple codeline based games to test outcome.

* **SabberStoneCoreAi** *(.NET Core)*

  A test project to run A.I. simulations with predefinied decks and strategys.

* **SabberStoneGui** *(.NET Framework)*

  A test project that shows off a visual implementation of the SimpleAi project. This is probably where beginners should start looking at. There is a simple GUI which allows different decks to play against each other with different strategys. Check out the Wiki [Link](https://github.com/HearthSim/SabberStone/wiki/SabberStoneGui) for informations about the use of SimpleUi.
